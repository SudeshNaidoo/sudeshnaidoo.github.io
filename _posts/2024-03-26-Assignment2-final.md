## Assignment 2- Executive summary

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<p>There are five trends as per Viswanathan, R., & Telukdarie, A. (2021),mentioned in their paper, a systems dynamics approach to SME digitalization, which states that the first requirement for business to govern the future working culture of SME's is that business need to operate online, and the decision to go digital is an important factor that your company has decided to take. The issue you may encounter once digitalized will be finding  capable resources and upskilling of current staff, as support becomes crucial for sustainability models (Viswanathan, R. et al. 2021).</P>
<p>Another trend identified, is adoption of cloud, which is the solution that is recommended for your business applications and business continuity requirements. Digitalization also brings about productivity, cost reduction and through new business models, a competitive edge. (Viswanathan, R. et al. 2021).
The last three trends that govern the future work culture to grow your digital business are the use of Chat bots, Business adjusting according to millennials and lastly the use of Social media models (Viswanathan, R. et al. 2021).</p>
<p>Singularization of a good or product within a supply chain, occurs with globalization of your supply chain. This will help distinguish your product from other goods and satisfies a demand that other goods cannot meet (Callon, M. 2021).  The life of the product may be modified as the product may change based on variation of ingredients, pricing requirements (Global village), better ingredients, technology changes, could mean packaging, a new recipe, or a better way of doing business. Refer Appendix A for Qualitative Risk Assessment completed. If none of these modifications are required then changes in product output should not vary from the original recipe. Cyber specific factors that are known to affect chain production are human errors, hostile actions (cyber-attacks, misuse of data and unauthorised disclosure), application errors, system or network malfunctions, and physical damage such as fire or natural disasters (Schrader, D. 2023). All these factors can be viewed in Appendix A.
Business performance was measured by  Viswanathan, R. et al. 2021, for new SME's over a hundred months and the criteria used is shown in the graph below. Digitalization  shows as one of the major criteria to increase business performance. The other key factor that must be considered as mentioned earlier is having  highly skilled staff, which in the long term increases business performance and thereby increases profit.

<p>Probability calculation based on the Monte Carlo simulation and completed from data taken from the  book Enterprise Risk Management Models, Risk matric chapter 2 (Olson, D. L., & Wu, D. 2020).
Potential risks to the quality and supply chain include:
•	Current development capability
•	Technological risk
•	Intellectual property protection
•	Manufacturing and service delivery system
•	Socio-political risk
•	Expected quality
•	Customer behaviour
•	Competitor risk
•	Environmental risk
•	Financial risk
</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo Simulation model approach would be suggested as it involves a simulation of a set of assumptions  concerning the relationship amongst the various components used.  The model allows for uncertainties to be included using probabilistic inputs such as demand, competition, marketing branding etc.  Supply chain decisions involve a number of factors where there is uncertainty on the response  and a simulation is the best manner in which to arrive at a decision or justify a certain action. Poisson distribution gives the probability of an event occurring a specified number of times within a given period. It has only one parameter which equates to the number of events (Turney, S. 2022).</P>
 
<p>List of assumptions used in the assessment include:
⦁	A predetermined assessment of frequency of each risk element taking place.
⦁	Assessment of risks prevalent in terms of the Pet Food industry, aligned to a risk category.
The results indicate a relevant distribution of probability in terms of the risks identified based on the frequency identified.  Refer to Appendix B for model iterations, of which two thousand were run.</p>
 
<p>
⦁	Probability is impact times severity. The potential risk of loss of quality is around 4% based on the graph above. 

Recommendations around the potential risk of loss of quality 
Risk	Recommendation
The product may not find its intended audience  or face competition.	Market assessments should be done, to ensure that the product and process of marketing aligns to market requirements.  Assess competitors who offer similar services or products to ensure that we are competitive to maintain or attract more market share
Focus on increased production of product for global or increased distribution can impact on quality control.	Align with ISO or formal methodologies in terms of quality control to ensure that quality is not compromised in trying to gain more market share.
Lack of consideration for environmental factors – from warehouse settings and the environment in which the product needs to be kept has to be regulated.	Assessment will need to be done carefully of each new location globally to assess the ability to provide the right environmental and warehouse conditions to house the product and keep it aligned to quality.
Lack of training, supervision, communication, motivation and capability can impact on the quantity of human errors in production and distribution.	Assessment and training programs aligned to the quality levels can be put in place to ensure that this is kept up to standard, as well as inspections at regular intervals.</P>

Potential risk of supply chain issues including a list of potential issues with associated probability of them occurring. 
Potential supply chain issues	Probability
Inventory management systems are not the same at all locations resulting in systems not being able to speak to each other.	0.2%
Unknown site conditions in various locations can affect the recruitment of staff as well as the impact of environmental factors which affect production and distribution.	9%
Lack of proper systems or software to track change order management and inventory management.	2.8%
Inadequate project management methodologies could impact on both the set-up of new sites as well as the day to day operational management of supply and demand. 	0.4%
Irregularities or non-compliance with industry regulations for warehouse quality control relating to documentation, labelling, testing, certification and packaging. 	0.4%
Lack of continuous improvement in terms of looking for ways to stay competitive, meeting customer expectations  and reducing costs and risks.	4%
</p>
<p>The requirement for business continuity to be available 24/7/365 with a recovery point objective (RPO) of under one minute requires an active- active system. This requires dual architecture running and replicating at the same time in different regions. This is a costly solution as it will require a traffic manager which monitors both systems to detect any network or system failures and automatically switch to the region that is error free. Your  SQL databases should be configured to use always on availability group( AOAG). The overall cost could be lowered by using a shared cloud, in which reserve processing capability is cost shared by  multiple applications belonging to various organizations (Alhazmi, O. & Malaiya, Y. 2013).
There are key considerations to using DRaaS, which include the initial cost, transfer of data cost, storage costs and software licensing fees. (Alhazmi, O. & Malaiya, Y. 2013) The cost of security can be lowered by using public cloud due to the economy of scale (Alhazmi, O. & Malaiya, Y. 2013) </p>
<p>My recommendation is to use Microsoft Azure as a hot backup with a mirrored data failover (Alhazmi, O. & Malaiya, Y. 2013) . Using Microsoft allows other options such as Office 365 which can be integrated with free applications such as excel and word,  which can be negotiated into one support contract (Vice, K. 2023). There are also two availability zones (Harris,A. et al. 2024)  close to your brick and mortar facility, one in London and one in Ireland (Azure. n.d).  An availability zone is a separate location within an Azure region, which contains one or more datacentres that have  independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure (Azure.n.d).</p>
<p>Vendor lock-in is a problem when moving to cloud. Vendor lock-in could occur due to non-standardization causing inoperability between different cloud service providers. Product offering change and no longer apply to your business but due to excessive costs and technical issues the move cannot be done easily or the vendor may go out of business and your data needs to be moved. Vendor lock in prevents opportunity (Catser AI. 2023). You may even have license agreements under exclusive contracts (Opara-Martins, J. et al. 2014). To prevent this from occurring ensure you will need to research your cloud provider which in this case I suggested Azure, due to it being part of Microsoft, so it is unlikely to go under anytime soon. Ensure your SLA provides for your service requirements, such as elastic cloud storage ie variable service levels (Wikimedia. 2015). This allows storage, capacity and performance to expand automatically when required and diminish when not. Also make sure you know the cost of data transfer should it be required and when your contract ends rather than signing an evergreen contract. Make sure your applications and data are portable(Opara-Martins, J. el al. 2014 ) and use open standards, avoid proprietary technology such as vendor API's (Catser AI. 2023) .</p>
<p>What also needs to be considered is GDPR when storing and moving data. Once clients consent to store their data in cloud where one of the regions will be across the border ,is given, it would be advisable to encrypt data at storage and transportation, currently I would advise using AES256 encryption. The encryption key can be stored by you so that should you no longer require the cloud services the key can be deleted and the stored data in the cloud will become unusable. The same applies if the key is lost.</p>
<p>
In conclusion we have noted that the probability of change in product variation based on Monte Carlo simulation (Appendix B), is only 4%. This can be used to assure your clients that unless the recipe is changed, the variation in product output is exceedingly small. The provided requirements for disaster recovery informs that an active-active system is required and security costs could be lowered based on using public cloud due to the economy of scale. GDPR considerations are definitely a requirement and recommendation is to encrypt data in transport and storage, and not to use any client information for marketing unless authorised by the client. Vendor lock-in requires serious considerations and having the proper SLA in place with interoperable systems. Portable data and applications are necessary. Lastly digitalization is the future and culture changes that come with it must be considered.
