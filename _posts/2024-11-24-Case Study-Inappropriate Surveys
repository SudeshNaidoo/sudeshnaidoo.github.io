<H1>Reflective Activity 2 - e-Portfolio
Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</H1>
<p>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.
Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.
Record your findings in your e-Portfolio. You can also submit your findings to your tutor for formative feedback.</p>

<p>Deception and manipulation seems to be the order of day. Cambridge Analytica was using Facebook data which was sourced from a Cambridge professor who worked for a US presidential candidate (Clark 2018). This breach compromised between 30 to 80 million Facebook users accounts (Clark 2018).  Through a Facebook  quiz app which exploited a loophole via an API allowing the collection of the users personal data and their friends data. This analytical software was first tested in 2016 when the UK voted to exit BREIXT and it seemed the work then  ((Kanakia, Shenoy and Shah 2019).</p>

<p>This quiz app created by Dr. Aleksandr Kogan a Cambridge professor for understanding a users psychology. It was developed specifically for Facebook and was called ‘thisisyourdigitallife’ ,under the premise research ((Kanakia, Shenoy and Shah 2019).
The terms of Facebook at the time did not mention that a developer was permitted to harvest user data for research purposes but did not explicitly mention that they were not allowed to collect the users friends data as well.((Kanakia, Shenoy and Shah 2019).
 Once the user click the login app for survey via Facebook ,they authorized the app to collect their data and their friends user data as well.((Kanakia, Shenoy and Shah 2019).</p>
<p> Data collected was collated into segments based on what the users bought or liked and what that meant in terms of what they thought was important to them. Specific ads were then targeted to these segmented groups like lower tax rates and economic policy for the wealthy (Kanakia, Shenoy and Shah 2019).
 The Donald Trump campaign invested in Facebook for the last few months of his campaign and all the advertising was run via Cambridge Analytica, which also had loose ties to Russia (Clark 2018). He outcome spoke for itself.</p>

<p>The loophole in the contractual terms of Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica’s unethical behaviour to gain access to millions of records which will sustain the companies development for years to come.  I am not sure what other unethical consequences this data analysis could provide but it will hopefully come to light. This is also a good case on why data privacy is such an important factor in the data / cyber world.</p>
<p>There seems to be a few AI algorithms that decide what you should and should not view or listen too, for example Spotify makes suggestions on what you would like to listen to based on what you have chosen previously (Noor 2018). So tailoring to your likes might be just as dangerous and manipulating what you should listen to or view as this influences your direct inner sphere of influence, such as friends and family.  Wiewiorowski a European data protection supervisor stated, ’it’s only a matter of time until we see another scandal ‘ in his response to what tech companies should have learnt about from the Cambridge Analytica scandal (Heikkilä 2023).</p>
