<p>The music industry has a problem that persists still to this day. Be it in copyright infringement or accusations of copying certain types of beats or lyrics of music. Artists have asked for an application to be developed so that an artist’s copyright materials can be protected from threats such as piracy. We have been approached and asked to develop this application.</p>

<H2>Scope:</H2>
<p>The application requested to be developed is required to protect the copyrights that the artists have over their music scores, lyrics, and records. These items need to be on a regular basis checked for integrity and regularly checked to see whether any changes have been made to the artifact of the artist (music score, lyric or record). Normal users should only be able to manipulate their own artifacts while only being able to view other users’ artifacts. Administrators of the system should have access to all artifacts with the ability to manipulate the artifacts as well. All the user information and artifacts need to be stored in a database. The application must be a console based application and written in Python 3.x.</p>

<H2>UML Diagrams:</H2>
<p>According to Gedam and Meshram (2023), it is important to use unified modelling language (UML) during software development, especially during the initiation phase. UML provides consistency during the software development life cycle (SDLC) process and enables the software to be visualized. The diagrams below will illustrate the structure of the program and the execution of the program. All the diagrams illustrated here were made using the Visual Paragadim software which allows people to design UML diagrams.</p>

<H2>Class Diagram:</H2>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the different classes that would have to be implemented in the program and how the classes communicate with each other in the program.</p>

<H2>Use Case Diagram:</H2>
<p>This diagram shows the actors who would be involved in the system. There are two main actors who would be involved in this system. The administrator and the user.</p>

<H2>Component Diagram:</H2>
<p>A component diagram is used to model the software architecture of a system and provides a view of the physical software components that are required for the systems, interfaces and all the relevant dependencies (Banas.D,2012).</p>

<H2>Sequence Diagram:</H2>
<p>Sequence diagrams are responsible for showing the order in which your different objects would interact and react with each other. 
There are two diagrams showcasing each user. The first diagram shows the “normal user”.</p>

<p>The second diagram shows the administrative user and how they interact with the system.</p>

<H2>Activity Diagram:</H2>
<p>Activity diagrams is a UML diagram that looks very similar to a flow chart showing everything that takes place from the start of the program to the end of the program. Suriya and Nivetha (2023) pointed out that activity diagrams logically display the flow and relation of various activities.</p>

<H2>Implementation:</H2>
<p>This application will be coded in Python 3.x or higher with it being a console application. Passwords and encryptions will be handled with Pythons in-built B-Crypt library.</p>
<H2>Conclusion:</H2>
 <p>With the need for a system to safe guard the copyright qualities of artists, we have been asked to develop a console based application in Python which will allow artists to protect their music and linked resources ensuring that no piracy can take place for their music. The UML diagrams designed will provide the framework on which this needs to be built and how it should run at the end of the day. </p>
