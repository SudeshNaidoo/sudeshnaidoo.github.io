<H1>State -sponsored cyberterrorism in global politics </H1>
<P>The  question that came to mind first was why would a state-sponsor cyberterrorism ? and what is the effect in global politics.  A unique dataset was used by Hunter, Lance et al. 2021, in their journal ’‘ factors that motivate state-sponsored cyber attack”.  It also mentions that wars will be fought in the future via mouse clicks rather than via invading forces and dropping bombs (Hunter, L.2021).  Something to delve into would be, is this better for humanity due to less deaths caused by this type of warfare or would this cause just as many deaths as normal warfare.  To answer the affect cyberterrorism has on state-politics we just have to look at a response from the US Senator John McCain when he called the Russians meddling in the US 2016 elections an act of war. War in political rhetoric is a power play and used to hype media (Lotrionte, C. 2018) . War definitions legally grant varying powers to politicians and in terms of Cyber war or cyber terrorism there are less definitions of what prescribes reason for retaliation and international laws that can be used (Lotrionte, C. 2018).
The United Nations Charter and the law of armed conflict do not have directly applicable sections (Lotrionte, C. 2018). </P>

<P>Some political power plays that were attributed to cyberattacks was in 2019 when allegedly the US attacked Venezuela's power systems causing widespread panic, looting and deaths as they wanted revenge against the then President Maduro for insulting the US and they wanted him out. Brazil had a similar story but it was denied by the government( Libicki, M. 2020). The only verified cyber attack on a power grid happened in the Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 (Libicki, M.2020). Due to the threat of possible malware disrupting the nuclear weapon control systems in Russian,they have moved some of their nuclear weapons to Cuba (Libicki, M.2020). What's interesting is that the Ukraine power grid has been under attack since 2016 for sharing electricity with the Crimea region and since this did not work as a deterrent, Russia and Ukraine are now at war. We can infer from this that cyberattacks could become a precursor to forcible attacks.<P>  

<P>Back in the 1990’s Russia considered information as a weapon and declared a threat of nuclear strike against any nation that would attack their information systems (Thomas, T. 2020). They further break down information into information-technical and information-psychological  (Thomas, T. 2020), which gives some insight in the way this government thinks and controls it information. This breakdown of information as weapons  allows Russia to destroy, distort, mine or obtain information after penetrating defense systems / firewalls (Thomas, T. 2020).  This then begs the question what is happening to all our data that runs through companies such as Google and CISCO where most of the worlds information can be seen. The patriot act of the US allows them to request personal information for investigative purposes ( Dept of Justice. N.D). It is possible that other countries are doing the same under legal protection such as state terrorism acts of some sort.</P>

<H2> How does a country prepare for cyber-terrorism? </H2>
<P>In the US the joint chiefs of staff use the term information warfare to describe the growing threats of cyberterrorism ,electromagnetic and informational activities that could be used to destabilize the US and its allies and maintain a strategic advantage (Fogarty, S. et al. 2020). It currently has an army cyber command (ARCYBER). ARCCYBER is the foundation for the Department of Defenses( DoD) information network. They have to successfully defend the network, data and interconnected weapons platforms from attack as a prerequisite for a successful Army and Joint operations  (Fogarty, S. et al. 2020).  The Marine corps have followed suit and have an information warfighting function (Paul, C. 2020). The DoD produced the first Strategy for operations in information environment in 2016  (Paul, C. 2020). The paper by  Paul, C. 2020, “Understanding and Pursuing Information Advantage.”   looks for the definition of information advantage and looks in depth at this concept. This is possibly most likely for many countries, and further documentation into such secretive sensitive documentation would be impossible to attain for further study and investigation.</P>

<H2>Countering Threats:</H2>
<P>The journal on Cyber threat characterization speaks to threat modeling, by Jabbour, Kamal T., and Erich Devendorf (2017), which might be slightly outdated as at the time AI and machine learning were not included into many threat models. So it would be prudent to check journal publication dates when referencing certain technical information. Countering cyberterrorism journal by Henry, Shawn, and Aaron F. Brantly (2018)  seems to be that sharing of information in a co-operative Government and public sector worked better after the 9/11 attacks and legislative changes due to the attacks. This might be a page that the international law and co-operation between allies need to do.<P>

<H2> Conclusion: </H2>
<P>Most literature on the topic seems to lean towards countries with nuclear weapons and protection of these should a cyberterrorist act occur. This is definitely concerning and possibly a worse case scenario and therefore cover from a political concern as well.  Further investigation would also need to be put into place for NATO countries that do not have nuclear weapons and this may be an angle hackers could use to infiltrate joint command centers.  Do army command centers use standard software that we all use such as Microsoft operating systems ?  If yes ,are they then vulnerable to the same malware exploits? I do think these types of questions were deliberately left out based on the threat level it could impose and as mentioned would not be easy to find information on should this be questions for further study. The secondary but just as devastating consequence, would be an attack on all major corporations that hold majority of the IT sector. There aren’t many and if a combined state-sponsored attack on all these companies at once bringing down digital financial systems for a few days, would have catastrophic effects on global markets. Who would gain from such an attack?, possibly smaller companies that provide the same services or countries that don’t rely on manufacture but on commodities such as gold.
There seems to be a lot of journal literature available on the subject as it is interesting and certain deductions can be made such as the Ukraine cyber attack being a prelude to a war. So there is no doubt that cyberterrorist is an act of war.  Although based on the information available there sems to be a lot of loopholes available for hackers to hide behind and international law seems to still be catching up with the rate of technological advancement. For example the US patriot act has only recently added to their wire tap options to include new technologies and new threats (Depart of Justice. N.D).</P>

<P>All the journals have been research based papers with none having qualitative data to support evidence of cyberterrorism attacks. This could easily be explained, due to the sensitivity and secrecy of the data sets that would allow research of such attacks, also the sheer volume of attacks that occur daily and determining state-sponsored attacks for specific reasons would be difficult to prove and would be conjecture.
Technological advancements  over the centuries has changed warfare from the development of gunpower, the industrial revolutions and the information revolution that has increased the growth of cyberspace (Ball, D. and Gary, W. 2013).</P>
