## Unit 12  - Refection 

<H2>Reflection on Module: </H2>

<p>I am an IT/ cyber risk manager and was expecting this module to cover what we did at work and was of the option that I should have applied for an exemption to the module.  This would have been a mistake. The modules from module one  to twelve were interesting and cover a varied learnings that would help doing a cyber assessment to a traditional operational risk assessment.</p>
<p>The collaborative discussions were interesting and help clarify main points that caused me to think a little more deeply about accepting assessments such as CVVâ€™s and similar. More thought is required when using predetermined assessments on systems and applications as they may have known short coming which are not disclosed within the  assessment itself.</p>
<p>Threat modeling was interesting and showed me a deeper path that one could take when analyzing security threats and vulnerabilities whilst incorporating it into working models. The quantitative and qualitative modeling took some extra reading, not in understanding but implementing in the assignment. It also emphasized how I should work and that is within my strengths, although nice to know how the Monte Carlo systems and other quantitative models worked it is not something I would do on my own in a hurry. Mostly due to time and data required to complete such an assessment. Thinking further along, I would rather do a qualitative assessment for my thesis.</p>
<p>The module on standards showed that the the main standards we use at work are current. PCI DSS is a very interesting  standard as the same controls, although not all such as Pan requires, but many of the security IT controls can be implemented for GDPR, such as the encryption in storage and transport , as well as the obfuscation requirements could be leveraged. In South Africa we have taken guidance from the GDPR and implemented the POPI act. What was also interesting was reading material on the assurance certifications such as ISO27001 and variants to ISO.</p>
<p>The group project allowed me to get to know some of the other students in my class. It was not easy to meet online due to the timeline variations ,but the group were mature enough and focused  to complete the task at hand.Just a few online messages and one zoom call, we got the assignment completed.</p>
<p>
In completing the final task I ran into issue with my GitHub repository. I add a new skin to the GitHub pages and consequencely corrupted the repository. I had to create a new repository, a few days before submission. 
In conclusion this was and interesting and thought provoking module, in which I earnt a lot and many things which I can implement at work to improve the security posture of the company.</p>
